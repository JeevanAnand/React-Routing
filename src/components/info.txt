Unlike Frame Works Like Angular,React doesnt have the concept of routing 

React is a simple lightweight library and not a complete framework

React is only responsible for rendering the view

Command to install React Router DOM
npm i react-router-dom@4.3.1

Above library is the implimentation of react router for DOM or Browser

Similarly we have rect-router-native,it is used for mobile applications
